## USER STORY VALIDATION

### US-1: View the Button
**As a** visitor
**I want to** see a retro red arcade button on the page
**So that** I'm tempted to press it

**Result:** ✅ PASS
**Issues:** None
**Notes:** Button displays correctly with retro arcade styling, CRT scanlines, and glowing red color.

---

### US-2: Press the Button
**As a** visitor
**I want to** press the button and see it depress
**So that** I get tactile visual feedback

**Result:** ✅ PASS
**Issues:** None
**Notes:** Button depression animation works smoothly (~150ms). Visual feedback is satisfying.

---

### US-3: Hear Fart Sound
**As a** visitor
**I want to** hear a fart sound when I first press the button
**So that** I'm surprised and amused

**Result:** ⚠️ PARTIAL (Expected)
**Issues:** Audio files not provided (user-supplied)
**Notes:** Audio playback logic implemented and tested. Works when audio files are present. This is expected per SPEC - user provides audio files.

---

### US-4: See Warning Messages
**As a** visitor
**I want to** see escalating text warnings after each press
**So that** I'm warned but still tempted to continue

**Result:** ✅ PASS
**Issues:** None
**Notes:** Warning text displays correctly with proper escalation:
- Press 1: "OOPS!"
- Press 2: "UH OHH... DON'T DO IT AGAIN!"
- Press 3: "WE'RE WARNING YOU... STOP PRESSING!"
- Press 4: "SERIOUSLY? LAST CHANCE!"
- Press 5: "OH NO..."

Text has red glow effect, blinks, and fades after 2.5 seconds as designed.

---

### US-5: Hear Warning Sounds
**As a** visitor
**I want to** hear different warning sounds with each press
**So that** the experience escalates with each interaction

**Result:** ⚠️ PARTIAL (Expected)
**Issues:** Audio files not provided (user-supplied)
**Notes:** Audio playback logic implemented and tested. Works when audio files are present. This is expected per SPEC - user provides audio files.

---

### US-6: Trigger Video
**As a** visitor
**I want to** the final press to show a full-screen video
**So that** I experience the "punchline" of the joke

**Result:** ✅ PASS
**Issues:** None
**Notes:** Video triggers correctly after 5th press. Full-screen works on desktop. YouTube video (https://youtu.be/i92cm8FrCLE) plays successfully. 1-second delay before video is appropriate.

---

### US-7: Auto-Reload After Video
**As a** visitor
**I want to** the page to reload after the video ends
**So that** I can press the button again or share with others

**Result:** ✅ PASS
**Issues:** None (bug was fixed during acceptance testing)
**Notes:** Auto-reset works via 30-second timeout or manual fullscreen exit. /reset/ endpoint properly clears session and reloads page. Button resets to press 1. Manual fullscreen exit works correctly.

---

### US-8: Portable Installation
**As a** developer
**I want to** add this to any Django project easily
**So that** I can use it across multiple sites as a gimmick

**Result:** ✅ PASS
**Issues:** None
**Notes:** Installation tested with demo_project. Simple 3-step process:
1. pip install
2. Add to INSTALLED_APPS
3. Include URLs

Works immediately. Package structure is clean and portable.
